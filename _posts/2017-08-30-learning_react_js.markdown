I am writing a React JS version of the Dots game. The program creates a grid of dots and 2 players take turns connecting the dots. If a player completes a box then their ID appears in the box. That's as far as I have gone. Next I will add up all the completed squares for each player and when the last two dots are connected a winner will be displayed. After that I will allow  options for the size of the grid and for custom IDs. Finally I will code a computer player and give the user the option of having 0, 1 or 2 computer players. Dots is a very simple game for humans but coding it is good practice in using React JS and CSS. I am sure my version is not the most elegant one. But it is all mine and so far it seems to work well.
