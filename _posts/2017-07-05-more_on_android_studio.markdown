I have written my first Android app. It isn't very clever or exciting, but it is all mine. It is a little sycophantic quiz about the employer I am trying to impress. There are 6 statements that are presented sequentially with true and false buttons. A toast appears after the user selects one of the buttons telling them if they are correct or explaining why they are wrong. There are Android device emulators that you can test your apps on. Unfortunately they are very resource demanding and my old desktop cannot cope and the emulators won't work for me. So I zipped up the application folder and tried to send it to my son to test for me on his more powerful laptop. Unfortunately the compressed file was 17MB and the email failed. He was able to download it from github to test it and the app worked well. When (if) I get a job that requires me to use Android Studio I will need to invest in an android device that I can plug in to the old desktop so I can do my own testing, that or buy a more powerful computer so I can run the emulators.
