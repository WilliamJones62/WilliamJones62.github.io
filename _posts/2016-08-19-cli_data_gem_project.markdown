This project has really helped to bring together knowledge gained in different parts of the OO section. CLI, collaborating objects and Nokogiri have all come together to create this gem.

The most difficult part of the project was deciding what to do. But because I like football (soccer as you probably call it) I was able focus on that. 

Wikipedia has a fairly standard format for pages of a similar type. So all English Championship football club pages can be scraped with the same code which made the coding a lot simpler. Once I got the code working for one club page it worked for them all. It was difficult to figure out a quique set of identifiers from the wikipedia page for the English Championship to allow extraction of a list of clubs. I was getting duplicate data from different parts of the page. But after a bit of fiddling around I got rid of the duplicates.

The most useful thing I did was to stop trying to code the solution. I wrote out the logic of the code first. Then I wrote the tests I wanted to do. And then I wrote the code. Going straight into coding is too difficult for me and I get lost in the code.
