Tommorow is a big day. A local company that does really interesting and cutting edge work for a lot for Fortune 500 companies have asked me to come in for a technical interview. They have told me it will be a logic problem interview as opposed to a knowledge based interview. Admiitedly I am a little nervous. I am hoping for the best but trying to prepare for the worst.

I did the free Interview Cake (https://www.interviewcake.com) questions, and I am ploughing through the Hacker Rank problems (https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges). One thing that I really need to stop myself doing is diving into coding a solution to a problem before considering other, possibly better alternatives. Brute force solutions work, they can even be tuned up a bit to make them more efficient, but sometimes they are not the best solution. For example if you have an array of integers and you want to find the biggest product from a combination of any 3 it would be tempting to have 3 nested loops and find the product of every possible combination and store and replace the biggest product as you go. But with a bit of thought it becomes obvious that a single pass through the array and storing and replacing the 3 largest integers as you go and then finding the product of those integers after the loop is the better option.

So my plan is to listen to the problem, ask questions to clarify the problem, and then take a deep breath and consider the alternative solutions. In fact showing that there is a brute force solution and hopefully a more efficient alternative might be what they are looking for. Who knows! But I will be as friendly as possible and try to ask intelligent questions of the interviewer and do my best.
