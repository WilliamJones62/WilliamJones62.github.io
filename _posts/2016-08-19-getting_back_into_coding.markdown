I decided to do this course because pig farming is very hard work and I am getting too old to do it.

For 18 years after finishing college I wrote batch and CICS Cobol applications for various financial institutions. I wanted to spend some time with my kids before they got too cool to want to spend time with me so I started a free range pig farm. 11 years later my youngest would rather be with her friends than me so I think it is time to get back to coding. 

Ruby seems very popular with potential employers, and I like to learn new things, so here I am.
