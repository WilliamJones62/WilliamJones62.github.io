I am desperately trying to impress a potential employer. They use ReactJS. The React module on Learn came too late for me, so I am trying to teach myself ReactJS. There are a lot of online tutorials to choose from. The one I am using is 'Intro to React' (https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html). It walks you through the coding of a Tic-Tac-Toe game using React. I have found it to be relatively straightforward to follow and it has made the React code I have seen previously much clearer. 

I hope these people appreciate the effort I am putting in.
