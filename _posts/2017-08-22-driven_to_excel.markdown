I am doing everything I can to get a job. The company I am trying to get a place with is, at present, using software packages to enter data and Excel spreadsheets to extract the data they need to manage the company. I can see a lot of potential for writing bespoke code in Ruby on Rails and React to do a better job and much cheaper. But I have to get a job first. So they want me to create a 'dashboard' in Excel using pivot tables and a comma separated values (CSV) database. There are some useful online tutorials on Excel, for example the Excel Campus has a YouTube series (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NUjHBNWe9M) that steps you through the process of building pivot tables and combining them into a dashboard. Hopefully they will be impressed with what I do in Excel, and then I can get in there and show them what a real programmer can do to make the company better.
