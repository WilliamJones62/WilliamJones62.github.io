It is difficult to maintain a balance between searching for work (outreach emails, job applications, attending tech meet ups, preparing for interviews, etc), living a life (maintaining family and friend relationships, buying and cooking food, cleaning cars and the house, etc), and developing coding skills (applying what is already known to new applications, and learning things that are not covered in the curriculum but potential employers think are important to know for example closures in JavaScript).

Things can get a bit overwhelming. At times like this I think it is important to remember what made me think that becoming a web developer was a good idea, I mean apart from the piles of cash that I hope to make. I like to solve problems. I like the feeling of satisfaction that comes from turning an idea into a working reality. I like learning new things that I can then use to solve problems and make great code. That's what I try to remember when I get a rejection email, or no email at all. When my out reach emails seem to be getting me nowhere fast. When the people in the industry that do get in contact are not really very helpful.

So my words of wisdom are "maintain perspective", "remember what is important", "all the outreach emails and job applications are just a means to an end" and "keep on learning" because after all that is what got me started with this thing in the first place.
