In my continuing search for work I was put forward for a job at the social security administration. This is not a high tech startup. They have had mainframe computer systems since the 1960's and still have them. They were looking for someone with mainframe experience as well as knowledge of web development. The mainframe language they use is REXX (restructured extended executor), and the web development is in Python. I did say that my mainframe experience was mostly in Cobol and my web development experience was in Ruby, Javascript and Angular JS, not REXX and Python. This did not seem to deter them. So we set up the phone interview and in the intervening days I did some research on REXX and Python. Like most high level languages there were a lot of similarities to the languages I was already familiar with, plus a few idiosyncrasies such as Python using whitespace indentation to delimit blocks of code instead of say curly brackets. On a side note having looked at a number of languages now I don't understand why there are so many. If the reason is that some languages are more efficient in specific environments I can understand there being a few different ones, but the number is far more than can be explained by this reason alone. Anyway back to REXX and Python. According to the REXX Wikipedia page REXX is considered to be a precursor to the Python language (the Python Wikipedia page makes no mention of this), and REXX is a simplified version of the PL/I language. Back in 1986 I started my IT career at the Goodyear company in England. The language I learned to code in was PL/I (programming language 1). So if Wikipedia is to be believed (and when has it ever been wrong) I know Python's grandad. It's funny how things stay the same no matter how much they change.

If you are wondering why Python is called Python it's inventor was a big Monty Python's Flying Circus fan.
