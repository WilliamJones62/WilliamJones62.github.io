I have been in the interview process with a potential employer for the past 4 weeks. I did an automated video interview, a phone interview, an in person interview, a code challenge and now I will spend all day having multiple interviews and making a presentation. I have no idea what my presentation will be yet, probably a football fan app that I wrote with an Angular front end that I will rewrite to use React because that is what they use. I know they put people through all these hoops to make sure that they are getting the kind of people they want, but it is a good way for me to make sure that this is the right place for me. I hope it all goes well.

Anyway I have a week to get myself ready. I am using the tutorials I found at http://noeticforce.com/best-reactjs-tutorials-with-examples. I am adapting them to use the information I picked up from https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html. This is good practice for coding in React. I hope it will be enough to convince my interviewers that I am worth taking a chance on. Time will tell.
