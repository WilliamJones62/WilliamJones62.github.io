I had a chat with someone today who recommended learning Redux JS. Apparently it is very popular at the moment, can be used with other JS frameworks (such as React), and makes debugging complex applications easier. I did a Google search on Redux JS and found a lot of articles. As I know nothing about Redux I settled on 'Basics Redux' (http://redux.js.org/docs/basics/) which is part of the official Redux website (http://redux.js.org). There is a lot of really useful information and I am going to plow through it over the next few days to see how it can help me write better applications.
