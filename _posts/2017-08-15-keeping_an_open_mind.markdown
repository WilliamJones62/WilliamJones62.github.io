I have interviewed with a company that doesn't think that it needs programmers. It was a small company so people writing their own Excel spreadsheet was an okay way to extract needed data from their database. But growth (in sales and data) means that the current approach is a bit inefficient. Work is being duplicated, work that could easily be automated is being done manually, and the customer experience could be better. As a programmer every problem seems to require a program to fix it. A bit like a hammer seeing every problem as a nail. Although this is not always the case I think that this company could really use a programmer. So this is where the open minds come in. Can the company management be persuaded to see the benefits of bespoke programming solutions, and can the programmer be persuaded to see that sometimes third party packages are a better option. We shall see.
