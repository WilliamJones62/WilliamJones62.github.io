My daughter is a computer science major and attended a picnic put on by one of the companies that provides her with a scholarship. The owner of the company mentioned that a friend of his has a software company that is actively looking for programmers and she should apply. My daughter said that I was looking for work and he thought it was a good idea for me to apply too. As a side note I have sold a few pigs to the picnic guy over the years so he does know me. Anyway I applied not really expecting to hear anything back but the same day they invited me to take their automated video interview and the day after that they invited me to an in person interview. So you never know where job leads will come from.

The company is big on Android development. Not something covered in the Flatiron course. So I have spent the last couple of days trying to learn something about it. I got hold of the Big Nerd Ranch Android guide and down loaded the Android studio software (https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html?gclid=CjwKEAjwm7jKBRDE2_H_t8DVxzISJACwS9WbygUBhePlNBE9OJhvwNWcbcjM-dRjsrMi2uQSIjjyOhoCsCjw_wcB). The guide is a little older so it doesn't cover the latest Android stuff, and it expects you to use Eclipse to do the development work. But it does contain some easy to follow coding examples so that you can pick up the basics. Android studio is great, really easy to use. Android is coded in Java, which is something I have been learning to try and impress another potential employer. Hopefully this potential employer will be impressed by my proactive attitude and give me a job.
