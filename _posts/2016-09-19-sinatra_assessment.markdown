This assessment helped to bring together a lot of different parts of this section of the course. When doing an individual section it is sometimes difficult to see the relevance or relative importance of the information it contains. Questions like "How often am I really going to use this stuff?" and "Will this really help me get a job?" have crossed my mind. But during this assessment I was able to draw on the knowledge gain from various lessons to get the desired outcome for the project.

I did hit a major snag during testing the application. Updates seem to update all instances of a class not just the object that it was meant to. I found a work around by deleting and recreating the data, but this is far from ideal. I have done a lot of reading and can still not find the source of the problem.
