I just finished a day of interviews (almost 7 hours) with an employer I really want to work for. I won't know for a couple of days if I was successful, but fingers crossed.

The process taught me a couple of things that I thought I would share. They want people who will be helpful to the rest of the team, people who will share their knowledge with others and be friendly and approachable. If the job requires working in a team then these attributes would seem to be essential. They also want people who are curious about things and are willing to investigate on their own initiative. So it is a good idea to research a few things you are interested in before going to the interview. I am interested in history so I looked into Anglo-saxon Brittain from the departure of the Romans until the Viking invasion. The subject is unimportant it is just your willingness to learn. They also want people to go beyond the bare minimum of effort but take on extra work to make a project successful. I talked about the work I did on my pig farm, but again it could be anything. As expected there were a bunch of code challenges. If you can at least come up with a brute force approach and try to think of improvements on that it seems to be enough.

I hope I did enough to get the job because I am a bit tired now and I would not like to have to do all this again with another employer.
