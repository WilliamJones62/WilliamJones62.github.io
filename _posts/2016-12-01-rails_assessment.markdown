One thing I have learned from this assessment is that Rails apps can get very complicated very quickly. Putting together devise with nested forms and has many through relationships was not as easy as I had hoped. As this is my first attempt it is not too surprising. But I have learned a great deal, for example how to use collection_radio_buttons to load a foreign key in my join table, and how to use session cookies to pass data between the different models in the domain. I am sure the next app I develope will be much easier because of this experience. Another important skill I am slowly aquiring is how to use Google searches to find the answers to problems. It seems that every problem I have encountered has a solution that can be found with the correct Google search. The trick seems to be putting the correct key words into the search. Anyway I am glad it is finished and I look forward to the next part of the course.
