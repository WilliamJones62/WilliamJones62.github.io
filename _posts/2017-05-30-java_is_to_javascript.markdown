as car is to carnival, is an expression I have heard. I was put forward for a job that required Java. I told the employer that the Learn curriculum did not cover Java, but that I was willing to learn on my own over the next few days. I really thought that they would not be interested. However they said 'As long as you can Code in Java and understand the basics that can work.' So I got to it. There are a lot of online Java tutorials. I did the one at code academy https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java. It gives a good general introduction to the language. What I found it that it is not that dissimilar to JavaScript in terms of structure so it is relatively easy to pick up. Of course there are big differences, such as the declaration of variables, but it's not like learning Assembler! 

I then downloaded the Eclipe IDE so I could start writing my own Java programs. Eclipes is very user friendly with lots of time saving features, and it's free which is the best feature of all. I got the coding challenges from HackerRank https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/. They lead you into more advanced features than are presented in the Code Academy tutorial. So you learn as you code which is good for me.

I let the employer know that I have got the basics of Java and I am waiting for a reply. I hope my flexible attitude and willingness to learn new things will score some points.
