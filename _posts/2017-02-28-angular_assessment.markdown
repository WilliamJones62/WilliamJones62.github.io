There are many ways to skin a cat, so the expression goes. There are also many ways to code an Angular front end. There are so many features already built into Angular, and so many additional features that can be added that it can be overwhelming. It is difficult to know what the best approach to a problem is when you are not sure what all the possible options are. I suppose it is a bit like a the English language, it is possible to use 4 or 5 words to describe something but there might be one not widely used word that can do the same thing. As with most things in life it all comes down to experience and a willingness to learn. The more practice you have doing something the better you become (usually). 

As I come to the end of the course it seems that web development is more of an art than a science. Instead of one right way to do something, there are many ways to achieve the same end. Learning what works well, and being willing to acquire new knowledge to improve my code would seem to be the best way forward. Instead of being overwhelmed by the options available the attitude should be that there is always something new to learn. The end of the course is only the beginning of learning web developement..
