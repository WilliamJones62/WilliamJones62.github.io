(and the kindness of strangers)

I have been struggling with front end authorisation for a while. It seems odd that this part of my web development education is so limited. To me it should be one of the first things you learn if you are going to produce commercially useful web apps. After some searching I found an extremely useful article by Ryan Chenkie called Easy AngularJS Authentication with Auth0 [https://www.sitepoint.com/easy-angularjs-authentication-with-auth0/]. This walks you through the process of setting up authorisation using Auth0 on an AngularJS front end. This was all new to me and I got myself in a bit of a bind and could not seem to get things working even though I was sure I had followed the steps in the article exactly. So as a long shot I sent an email to Ryan asking for help, but not really expecting a reply. Amazingly within an hour he replied and helped me fix my problem over the course of 14 emails! I am very grateful that he was so generous with his time and expertise. 

I now split my full stack projects into two parts. The Angular JS front end (client) and the ruby on rails backend (server). This may seem obvious, even to me now, but it is not the way I was taught to develop my projects. Keeping them separate allows the project folders to be smaller and easier to manage. It is also more logical as commercial apps (as opposed to training apps) are unlikely to have the front end and back end running on the same device.

The lesson for me from this experience is that like Blanche from A Streetcar Named Desire I can depend upon the kindness of strangers. It costs nothing to ask for help and that help can be extremely useful. If I ever get to the point that my expertise can be useful to others I will remember Ryan's example and be generous too.
