Web development changes rapidly. It is what makes it interesting and a bit frustrating. What was the hot new thing quickly becomes out dated. Even within a product such as React the way things are done changes so much that an old React app (3 years or less) is almost unrecognisable compared to an app coded in the last 6 months. Keeping up with the latest trends and releases is almost a full time job. I wish I had a great answer for the best way to stay current. Doing a Google search for 'web development trends' followed by the current year turns up a lot of interesting articles although the question I always ask is 'Can I trust this source?'. Reading the latest document releases from Facebook, Google, etc can help too. That's about all I have.
