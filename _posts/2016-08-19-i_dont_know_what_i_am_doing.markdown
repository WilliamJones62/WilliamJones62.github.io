It is an unpleasant feeling to suddenly realise that you don't have a clue about what you are trying to do. 

I completed the free part of the course and thought I had completely finished the procedural and OO parts of the course so I plowed on into the SQL section. That went well I thought and so I started the ORM section. I quickly realized I was in over my head when I saw stuff about hashes and "self". I wondered if I had forgotten those things from the free part of the course, or whether I should be reading stuff off the internet on my own. Fortunately I decided to review the procedural section to try to refresh my memory. It was then I realised that I had lots of modules still to complete before I got to ORM.  

Now I am almost finished with the final OO project I think I won't be quite so lost when I get back to ORM.
