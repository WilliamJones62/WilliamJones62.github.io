There is nothing too profound in this blog post. It is all very obvious really. But I thought I might share my experiences with outreach emails. 

I was initially reluctant to send total strangers emails asking for advice. It seemed a little rude, a bit like someone turning up on your door step wanting to talk about life insurance or religion, or asking if they can borrow something. But it is all part of building a network which hopefully will lead to job opportunities. So I swallowed my pride (nerves) and plunged in. 

I started trying to contact people that went to the same college as me. As my college is in England and I live in Virginia the number of people I could find was very limited. Of the ones I could find that might be appropriate I received zero replies.

Next I contacted web developers in the geographical area I wanted to work. I recieved a total of two rather bemused responses. Neither wanted to talk but they both made some suggestions about places to look for work, such as Indeed and Monster (I was looking there already), and one suggested working for free (for example coding a website for a church or charity) to get some experience. This is something I am already doing. I have a friend who has a herd of cows and he wants to electronically store data on the individual animals that will allow him to manage them more effectively. There are some products out there that are quite expensive so I said I would do it for free. Anyway not the most productive responses, but better than nothing.

I then started searching for Flatiron graduates in my area. I found only one. I got in touch and we are going to meet this week to talk about job finding tactics. He has already got me on the local Slack jobs channel so I can see if anyone is looking for someone like me.

So the moral to this blog would be contact Flatiron graduates first. They seem much more likely to help than anyone else you cold contact.
