This week I have two appointments to talk with potential employers. It is difficult to know how best to prepare. Obviously finding out as much as possible about the companies by looking at their websites, Facebook and Linked In pages is a good start. Being able to ask meaningful questions based on that information should help the discussion move along more smoothly. Finding out something about the industries the companies operate in should also be time well spent.

Every interview I have had in the past has always ended with the employer asking if I had any questions for them. This can be tricky if all the questions I had prepared had already been answered. I have found that it is a good idea to have some general questions prepared that are unlikely to be covered during the interview such as 'What are some of the biggest opportunities and challenges that the company will encounter over the next few years, and how will information systems help address them?' If that question doesn't lead to a five minute reply I don't know what will.

Anyway next weeks blog will probably be entitled "What I should have done to prepare to talk to potential employers" and have all the insights I gained from my two appointments. Hindsight is a wonderful thing!
