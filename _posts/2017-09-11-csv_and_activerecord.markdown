I might be working with CSV (comma seperated values) files soon. I think that I might have to load the data from those files into an SQL database so that I can access the information using a Ruby on Rails backend. I am a little out of my depth but from the Google searches I have made so far it seems that I am not the first person to try to do this. I would like to write a React front end that uses the backend as an API so that the data will become available remotely. It is all very interesting and I am sure Iwill learn a lot as I go.
