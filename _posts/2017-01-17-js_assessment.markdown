As you all know there are a lot of parts to coding an app that uses Javascript and AJAX. It is like learning a new language, like German. There are somethings that are familiar like the phrase "komm her" which means come here and is pronounced the same way. There are other things that are completely different like "Einkaufstasche" which means shopping bag. I suppose that learning and retaining JS and AJAX, like learning German, gets easier the more you use it. 

However it seems to me that this analogy is faulty. HTML, Ruby, AJAX and JS are all part of the same language, the language of full stack web development. I am sure I am not the only one to think this but maybe instead of the current Frankenstien's monster approach of cobbling together different languages perhaps a new unified language that covers all aspects of web development would be better. There maybe some overhead issues interms of learning a whole new approach, but perhaps thay would be balanced by not having to master all the different parts of the current way of doing things. I suppose I am asking fot the equivalent of Esperanto. That has not exactly been a great success, but I think it was a good idea.
